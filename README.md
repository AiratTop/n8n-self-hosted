# n8n Self-Hosted with Docker

![n8n-self-hosted](https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/1070157632/1698cbad-672c-43cf-99fe-27d89a8fdc22)

This repository provides a Docker Compose setup for running a self-hosted [n8n](https://n8n.io/) instance with scaling capabilities.

## Features

- **Works out of the box:** Just configure the `.env` file and run the start script.
- **Scalable:** Runs n8n in `queue` mode with separate workers, ready for high loads.
- **Handles Large Files:** Configured to save binary data to the filesystem, allowing workflows to process large files without memory issues.
- **Ready-to-use Scripts:** Includes simple scripts to start, restart, and update the application.
- **Long-term History:** Execution history is stored for 2 months.
- **Secure:** Uses the latest recommended security environment variables for n8n.
- **Private:** n8n telemetry is disabled by default.
- **Full-featured:** SMTP is pre-configured for password recovery and other email functions.
- **Automatic HTTPS:** Uses Caddy as a reverse proxy for automatic SSL certificates.
- **Persistent Data:** Data is stored in a PostgreSQL database.
- **Caching:** Uses Redis for caching.

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed.
- A domain name pointed to your server's IP address.
- A `.env` file with the required environment variables.

## Usage

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AiratTop/n8n-self-hosted
    cd n8n-self-hosted
    ```

2.  **Create the shared network:**
    This setup uses a shared network to easily connect to external databases. If you haven't already, create the network:
    ```bash
    docker network create shared_network
    ```

3.  **Configure the environment:**
    Open the `.env` file and update the variables with your own settings.

4.  **Start the application:**
    ```bash
    ./start-docker.sh
    ```
    This will start all the services in detached mode and scale the `n8n-worker` service to 2 replicas.

5.  **Restart the application:**
    ```bash
    ./restart-docker.sh
    ```

6.  **Update the application:**
    ```bash
    ./update-docker.sh
    ```
    This will automatically create a database backup, pull the latest Docker images, and restart the application.

## Backup

This project includes a script to back up the n8n database.

To create a backup, run:
```bash
./backup.sh
```
This will create a compressed SQL dump of your PostgreSQL database in the `local_files/backups/` directory. It is recommended to run this script regularly (e.g., using a cron job).

## Connecting to Other Services

This n8n setup is part of a larger ecosystem of self-hosted services that can all run on the same `shared_network`. This allows n8n to securely connect to them using their container names as hostnames.
